# Disaster Recovery
*Disaster Recovery* is temporary response to the Covid-19 lockdown.  It allows students and Faculty to access the Bloomberg terminal remotely.  Disaster Recovery is expected to be removed when the lockdown ends.  After that point everyone will have to access Bloomberg through a physical machine. These will be located in the Bloomberg lab. 

To access Disaster Recovery you will need to get a Bloomberg education account and secure a Bloomberg terminal username and password.  Details about how you do that are below.
