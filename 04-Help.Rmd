# Getting help

You can always get help on any function by pressing F1i or hitting the **Help** key.  This will usually bring up an information sheet that covers the function that is being displayed.  It also possible to hit the **Help** key twice to bring up the message system. This will allow you to send a message to the Bloomberg support team.  The Bloomberg support team will answer questions about the way that the system works or where you can find specific information.
