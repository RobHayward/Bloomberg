# The Global Financial Crisis
In the 1990s and into the new century, there was a sense of complacency as the new macroeconomic regime seemed to have removed the threat of inflationary and unemployment shocks. Household debt rose by 8 percentage points between 1988 and 1998, and 29 percentage points between 1998 and 2008; financial debt rose by 29 percentage points 1988 and 1998 and 48 between 1998 and 2008. Central banks did little to prevent the build up in debt.  US Fed Chairman Greenspan promoted a view that the central bank should concentrate on moping up the aftermath with low interest rates to maintain a dynamic economy. The focus was on inflation.  However, the BIS pointed out the there are period when inflation can be low but rising debt can cause risk of disruption [@BorioWhite].

## Pre-crisis system: incentives, instruments and actors
By neglecting the social cost of its own bankruptcy, financial firms will tend to take on more risk than is optimal. The brief that strategically important institutions will be bailed out reduces their cost of capital and encourages them to take on more risk than they would otherwise. Banking sector gains are privatised while the losses are at least partly socialised. Lower regulation, lack of concern at the increase in risk and idea that new institutions had reduced the risk of macroeconomic shocks also increased the risk that was built up in the economy. 

There are three instruments at the heart of the crisis:  mortgage bonds, CDO and CDS. High quality triple A assets do not require equity to be held against potential losses.  There was increased interconnection and concentration in banking. 

The upswing: US government encouraged home ownership amongst the lower paid as a way to tackle poverty. There is an argument that says that support for sub-prime lending was a counter action to the fall in business investment after 2000 and the weakness of consumer spending as a result of stagnant real wages. This prevented the IS curve shifting to the left. Sub-prime mortgages extended credit to those previously constrained. Consistent with the financial accelerator more loans led to higher house prices and more lending and leverage. The higher the leverage the higher the returns and losses. Consumption functions have a strong wealth element in the US and UK. The transmission of risk across the globe was facilitated by light European regulation of housing assets, European government implicit guarantee for European banks.

##The Credit Crunch (2007-08)
The Fed was tightening from late 2004 onwards due to rising oil and other commodity prices. This eventually led to higher costs of borrowing and started to dampen house prices rises. When house prices started to fall, negative equity rose and the value of collateral started to fall. There was a rise in the default rate on home loans in February 2007. In August 2007 BNP Paribas stopped redemptions at some investments because it could not value its structured products. Short-term funding using housing securities as collateral became difficult. As financial tension increased other forms of collateral started to become less welcome and attracted larger **haircuts**. There was an increase in the spread between central bank money and the interbank rate. When CDO could not be valued and liquidity dried up parents had to fund the SIV that had been created. Northern Rock had only 23% of its funding from depositors in the summer of 2007. Bear Stearns was rescued in March 2008. On 15-September 2008 Lehman Brother collapsed.

In these circumstances the policy rate loses effect because the spread between lending rates and policy rate increases; zero-bond also provides a constraint on the policy rate. Figure 7.10 shows the collapse using the three-equation model. The fall in the housing market causes a fall in consumption and housebuilding, shifting the IS curve inwards; central bank wants to cut rates but is constrained by the zero bound; even when the nominal rate is cut to zero, it is impossible to get the economy on the MR line at point C; the increase in the spread between policy rate and lending rate meant that economy was at point X rather than D with a lower level of output and falling inflation expectations; the fall in asset prices will increase the real debt burden for debtors and make de-leveraging more difficult and painful.

## The GFC compared to the Great Depression
The policy response to the GFC was build on some lessons from the Great Depression: maintain liquidity; avoid protectionism. There are a number of comparisons of the Great Depression and the GFC. World trade was more robust, production fell by a smaller amount, money supply was stable and budget deficit increased by more in the GFC. Bernanke address the issues of liquidity and bank solvency. Governments took ownership stakes and supported banks and tried to remove the bought securities. Banks also used quantitative easing to tackle the zero bound problem. QE can help to reduce interest rates on longer lending by flattening the yield curve.

However, the GFC show the limit of monetary policy. The MR line needs to be reinterpreted as a PR and labelled PR to include fiscal policy as an instrument. In 7.1 the government would need to use fiscal policy to shift the IS curve to reach the point where there is a positive output gap. This is what largely happened in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis. Discretionary fiscal policy is the gap between the budget deficit and the effect of automatic stabilisers. 

Economic theory provides some guidance about the conditions under which fiscal stimulus is likely to be effective.  Fiscal stimulus is more effective if: it is accommodated by monetary policy; when it takes the form of a temporary rise in government spending; higher taxes and more borrowing to finance the spending may have some offsetting effects but this is not likely to be 100 per cent; taxes are cut to credit constrained households. The speed to economic adjustment to the GFC relative to the Great Depression suggests that the fiscal stimulus was effective. Though there was immediate fiscal support for economies, there was a swift move towards austerity. Discretionary fiscal policy was supportive in 2008-09 but contractionary in 2009-10, 2010-11 2011-12 and 2012-13 in US, UK and Advanced economies. The experience of the GFC caused the IMF to revise upwards its estimate of the power of the fiscal multiplier to 1.7 from 0.9.
